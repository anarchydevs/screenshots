## Legal Notices

This repository contains screenshots taken from Anarchy Online, and therefore copyright for these screenshots is most likely held by the copyright holder of Anarchy Online (at time of writing, Funcom Oslo AS). It is believed that use of these screenshots constitutes fair use under the Copyright law of the United States, due to the following reasons:

1. The images are used for commentary, research, news reporting and archival/preservation purposes.
2. The screenshots (a single frame of an interactive video game) depict a very small part of the overall work.
3. These screenshots are extremely unlikely to impact the potential market or value of the copyrighted work - i.e. these screenshots won't reduce demand for Anarchy Online.
